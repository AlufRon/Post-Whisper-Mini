About Post Whisper: 
Post Whisper platform Is used to manage Twitter Bots for the purpose of promoting Pro-Israel content using unique responses for each action. Adding Bots to the system and managing posts that the Bots will share and comment on using Gemini to generate the comment. 
On the platform, the user will be able to see the Bot’s activity statistics and engagement analytics, as well as manage what, when and how the Bots will interact with the posts he chooses, as well as determining the bots “personality traits”.
Our goal was to create an easy-to-use platform, that will automate social media interactions with the intent of promoting pro-Israel ideas on Twitter.
Using Typescript, React, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Tweepy, Gemini API and Twitter API, we were able to create such platform.
We have made the UI easy to use and clean – there are no complicated processes. The user only needs to input information, that will be transferred to the Database, which the Bot manager accesses to then generate the twitter interactions. More information will be given in the document.
